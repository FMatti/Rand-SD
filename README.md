Randomized estimation of spectral densities.

## Quick start

To reproduce our results run the following commands in a *Windows command prompt*

You may then run the jupyter notebooks located in the root directory.

## Thesis compilation

Having a working distribution of [LaTeX3](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) and make sure the commands `pdflatex`, `bibtex`, and `makeglossaries` work. You might need to add them to your path.

Having a working version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) and make sure the command `python` works. You might need to add it to your path.
