We study a family of methods used to approximately compute the spectral density
of large symmetric matrices which can only be accessed through matrix-vector
products. These methods are based on the polynomial expansion of a smoothing
kernel in combination with either a randomized trace estimation, randomized
low-rank approximation, or both simultaneously.\\

Initially, we give an introduction and overview of procedures which are used
to compute the spectral density of matrices. Then, we proceed to showing how
some matrix functions can efficiently be computed based on
their Chebyshev expansion -- the interpolation scheme of choice for our
methods. A first algorithm is proposed based on the Hutchinson's stochastic
trace estimator. Subsequently, the usage of a Nystr\"om low-rank approximation is
motivated and a second algorithm based on it is presented. Finally, a hybrid
method based on a combination of the two previously mentioned techniques is
discussed.\\

The techniques employed in these methods are motivated and introduced in a
rigorous manner. We present multiple implementation strategies for improved
computational speed, accuracy, and stability, and give a theoretical analysis
of each method. In various experiments the analysis of our algorithms is
numerically confirmed and their effectiveness is compared to other
conventionally used methods.
