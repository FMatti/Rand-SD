\todo{flesh out}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We were able to significantly improve upon many parts in \cite{lin2017randomized}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple, accurate, and explainable interpolation framework
        \item Multiple implementational improvements
        \item Could verify these results numerically
    \end{itemize}
    \item Things still to be done
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorporate Chebyshev interpolation in error bounds
        \item More efficient function evaluation/approximation than Chebyshev? (Lanczos)
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Generalized eigenvalue problem not well
    \item Interpolation degree required to be quite high, so not worth it
    \item 
\end{itemize}
