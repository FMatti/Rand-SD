\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\label{chp:0-acknowledgments}

I would like to acknowledge the support I was given by my supervisor
Prof. Daniel Kressner. His clear guidance and unparalleled expertise were the
critical success factor for my thesis. I appreciate him always being very generous
with his time despite his full schedule. In every meeting he filled my hands with
ideas, inspiration, and appropriate criticism. He assigned me a tasks on which
I worked well beyond the usual eight hour workday; not because I had to, but because
I wanted to and enjoyed every moment of doing so. I am grateful for all the
opportunities and favours he has given me.\\ %

My co-supervisor, Haoze He, also contributed heavily to me experience a great time
these last four months. With his tolerance for my mistakes, quick grasp of
complicated concepts, and critical thinking skills he was able to help me
perfectly in my work. Our many shared interests led to uncountable
entertaining conversations. Our collaboration together with Hysan Lam, who
as well helped me in countless ways, was to me one of the most exciting parts of
my thesis which brought many suprises and breakthroughs.\\

I am thankful for all the amazing people I could meet during my thesis.
The many interesting conversations I was able have over lunch with David, Peter,
Margherita, Angelo, and Nian always gave me inspiration and entertainment.
Them treating me as one of them made me feel accepted and motivated me to come
to the office every single day.\\

Finally, I express my gratitude for my teachers, family and friends.
If I was not for the many teachers who have inspired, mentored, and formed me
all my life long, I would not have been able to pursue this path.
My parents were always there for me and stood behind me no matter what I did.
Owing to them I can do whatever I am passionate about.
Thanks to my friends I could experience many great moments and adventures
during the time of working on my thesis, particularly with Jozef, Lucas, Bruno,
Irvin, Mateja, Bartul, and Paride.
