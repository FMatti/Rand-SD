\label{chp:0-acknowledgments}

I would like to acknowledge the immense support I was given by my supervisor
Prof. Daniel Kressner. His clear guidance and unparalleled expertise were the
critical success factor for my thesis. I appreciate him always being very generous
with his time despite his full schedule. In every meeting he filled my hands with
ideas, inspiration, and appropriate criticism. He assigned me a tasks on which
I worked well beyond the usual eight hour workday; not because I had to, but because
I wanted to and enjoyed every moment doing so.\\ %

My co-supervisor, Haoze He, also contributed heavily to me experience a great time
these last four months. With his tolerance for my mistakes, quick grasp of
complicated concepts, and critical thinking skills he was able to help me
perfectly in my work. Our many shared interests led to uncountable
entertaining conversations. Our collaboration together with Hysan Lam, who
as well helped me in countless ways, was to me an exciting part of my thesis
with many suprises and breakthroughs.\\

I am thankful for all the amazing people I could meet during my thesis.
The many interesting conversations I was able have over lunch with David, Peter,
Margherita, Angelo, and Nian always gave me inspiration and entertainment.
Them treating me as one of them made me feel accepted and motivated me to come
to the office every single day.\\

Finally, I express my gratitude for the support I was given by my family and friends.
My parents were always there for me and stood behind me no matter what I did.
With my friends I was able to share many great moments and adventures during
this time, particularly with Jozef, Lucas, Bruno, Irvin, Mateja, Bartul,
and Paride.
