\chapter*{About provable reproducibility}
\label{chp:0-reproducibility}

Provable reproducibility is an initiative I hereby launch, which pursues the
goal of making results found in articles, theses, and software packages easy to
reproduce and verify. No ambiguity, no data manipulation, no cherry-picked
parameters, and no hand-crafted results. Every figure, plot, table, formula, and
text in a provably reproducible project can be unequivocally traced back to where
it originated from. This goes one step further than merely uploading the
source code of a project, where a reviewer or user will have to go through the
tedious and often error-prone process of reproducing the results.\\

The proof is delivered by openly -- not locally -- recreating every aspect of a
project in an online archive. This includes, but is not limited to
\begin{itemize}
    \item downloading, importing or creating all the external dependencies which are being used (code, data, \dots);
    \item running all the computations and generating the corresponding results (plots, tables, \dots);
    \item and building the project outcome (article, report, \dots).
\end{itemize}
Such a reproduction pipeline can be implemented without too much effort by
using a CI/CD framework available in most contemporary software development
and version control services, such as GitHub and GitLab.
